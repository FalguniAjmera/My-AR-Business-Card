# My-AR-Business-Card
AR Business Card using Unity and Vuforia

I have used "spades 10" as my Image Target. When the Vuforia platform detects this "spades 10 card" in the field of view, it will render my business card. To make things fun, I used an animated 3D character which is placed above my business card.
